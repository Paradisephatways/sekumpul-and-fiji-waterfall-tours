  <h1 class="d-flex justify-content-center">Information About Waterfall Tour</h1>
  <h4 class="">Before we embark on the tour, there are a few items you should bring along to ensure a pleasant and enjoyable experience. Here's a detailed list of things to consider:</h4>
  <p>1. <strong> Swimsuits:</strong>As we'll be visiting various water attractions, having swimsuits will allow you to fully enjoy these activities.</p>
  <p>2. <strong>Towel:</strong> Bringing a towel is essential for drying off after swimming or participating in water-based activities. It's also handy for sunbathing or lounging on the waterfall.</p>
  <p>3. <strong>Sun protection:</strong>  It's crucial to shield yourself from the sun's harmful rays. Consider bringing sunscreen with a high SPF, a wide-brimmed hat, sunglasses, and protective clothing to minimize sunburn and other sun-related risks.</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Mosquito spray: </strong>  Depending on the location and time of year, there may be mosquitoes or other insects. Carrying mosquito spray will help protect you from bites and potential discomfort.</p>
  <p>5. <strong>Sturdy shoes:</strong>  As we may be exploring different areas, comfortable and sturdy shoes are recommended. Choose closed-toe shoes that offer support and traction, as some paths or attractions may be uneven or require walking.</p>
  <p>6. <strong>Slippers or water shoes:</strong>  While sturdy shoes are recommended for walking, it's also practical to bring slippers or water shoes for activities that involve water, such as swimming or walking along the waterfall.</p>
  <p>7. <strong>Money:</strong>  Although there's no need to purchase anything during the tour, having some spare money is convenient for snacks, drinks, and souvenirs. You may come across local vendors or stalls offering unique items or local delicacies.</p>
     <p> <strong>Age discounts </strong> <br>
Adult: 17 years and older pays full price. <br>
Child: 6 to 16 years pays half price. <br>
Toddler: 5 years old under is free.</p>
